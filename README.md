# UFOs

**Summary**

UFO sightings have been seen and reported on across the world. Compiling this information into a readable database, our project allows one to view learn more about these sightings for themselves. By filtering the said sightings by city, state, country, and shape of the spotted craft, the table shows these instances in a level refined detail.

**Results**

In order to access and view these data, the filter table on the left side of the screen must be used. Say, for example, I wanted to see reported sighting on 1/10/2010: by simply entering the date in question in the table, our website will sift through our database and display the 11 results, or 11 sightings from that day.

Further breakdowns can be enabled, as perhaps I was curious as to whether any of these sighting occurred in California. By keeping our date, but adding the state of CA (i.e. California) into our filter our program once more sifts through our database to show the 2 resulted sighting in California on that day.

**Summary**

Our program, though useful suffers from poor design and intuitive user-interface. A drop-down feature to our filter tables are usually helpful with these types of search engines, as otherwise, giving more readily-available information to the user when navigating that portion of the tool. In addition, one other thing to be included might be just an all-around better design. Our website is functional, but it doesnâ€™t look good. Even something as simple as a little detail and color would breathe a lot of life and energy into our program which would almost certainly enhance user experience.
